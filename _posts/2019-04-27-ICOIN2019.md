## Foreword

I went to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for [**ICOIN**](http://icoin.org/) at January 9-11, 2019. I spent a happy time and took many pictures at there.

But unfortunately, my mobile phone was broken and i lost all my photos.

Fine, if there is a chance, i will go there again.


## Supplement

I went to Malaysia for a holiday again in early July. So I can show some photos this time.
