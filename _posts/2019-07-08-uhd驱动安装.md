## Foreword

The research project what i am doing will end next year Jan. My supervisor asked me to do the hardware implementation. Then, i studied how to use the ubuntu and the GNU radio. 

Before using the GNU radio, we have to install the required dependencies. I found that some old methods can not work on ubuntu 19.04. In this case, i wirte down this article for your reference.

If you want to use the USRP in GNU radio, you hava to install the UHD driver.

## Procedure

### UHD driver installation

There are two methods to install the UHD driver.

#### 1. PPA installation from Ettus Research

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ettusresearch/uhd
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libuhd-dev libuhd003 uhd-host
```

#### 2. Manual installation

(1) Required dependencies

```
sudo apt-get -y install libboost-all-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev \
python-mako doxygen python-docutils cmake build-essential
```

(2) Get source code from GitHub

```
git clone https://github.com/EttusResearch/uhd.git
```

Then,

```
cd uhd/host
```

(3) Configuring and compiling UHD

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake  ../
make
```

Here, maybe you have to wait for around 30 minutes. Then, perform the self-check.

```
ctest --output-on-failure
```

(4) UHD installation

```
sudo make install
```

Then you need to set LD_LIBRARY.

```
sudo ldconfig
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
```

### GNU radio installation

## Install Dependencies

Before installing the GNU radio, we have to install the dependencies.

```
sudo apt install git cmake g++ libboost-all-dev libgmp-dev swig python3-numpy \
python3-mako python3-sphinx python3-lxml doxygen libfftw3-dev libcomedi-dev \
libsdl1.2-dev libgsl-dev libqwt-qt5-dev libqt5opengl5-dev python3-pyqt5 \
liblog4cpp5-dev libzmq3-dev python3-yaml 
```

Then, we can install the GNU radio.

```
sudo apt-get install gnuradio
```

## Postscript

These are the whole process of installing and configuring GNU radio on ubuntu 19.04. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
